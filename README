  -m value                     match cost
  -r value                     mismatch/replacement cost
  -f value -g value -h value   free end gap parameters: g(x) = f + g*x + h*ln x
  -x file                      substitution matix
  -M value -N value            thresholds for holistic alignment

Flags:

  -p                           don't negate matrix

  -v                           messages
  -h                           usage

Filename:

The input file has to be in either Clustal, Fasta, or Phylip format.  If more
than two sequences are given then Ngila will align each pair.

Example:

ngila -m 0 -r 1 -a 2 -b 0.25 -c 0.5 -M 10000 -N 10000 seqs.aln

SUBSTITUTION MATRIX

An example of the format can be seen in matrix/dna

ALGORITHM

Ngila implements a Miller and Myers (1988) candidate list method of sequence
alignment with the gap cost being of the form g(x) = a + b*x + c*ln x.  Ngila
will return the alignment with the minimum cost and has rules for breaking
ties.  Ngila's main alignment algorithm is divide-and-conquer, which requires
O(M) memory; but slower than a holistic, O(MN) memory algorithm.

Ngila implements a secondary, holistic algorithm for alignment, which is
faster.  The options -M and -N (-M is for the larger sequence) allow users to
specify thresholds for when the holistic algorithm is used instead of the DnC
algorithm.  For example, command 'ngila -M 5000 -N 5000 seqs.aln' will align the
sequences in 'seq.aln' via the divide-and-conquer algorithm, but when
subsequences less than or equal to 5000-5000 are being aligned, the holistic
algorithm will be used.
